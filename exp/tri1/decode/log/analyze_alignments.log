Overall, n_E accounts for 4.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, s_B accounts for 4.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, s_I accounts for 4.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.0,7) frames.
Overall, t_B accounts for 4.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,12.0,12) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 47.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 54.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 4.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (6,6.0,6)
