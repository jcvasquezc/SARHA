The optional-silence phone sil occupies 32.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 67.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 3.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 7.6 hours of data, or 5.1 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,22.8,73)
