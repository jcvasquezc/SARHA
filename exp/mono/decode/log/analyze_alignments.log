The optional-silence phone sil occupies 34.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 1.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.9 hours of data, or 1.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,22.6,63)
